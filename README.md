**APPS (Another Python Port Scanner) is yet another python port scanner**

*What does it do different?* ... Well, not much right now, but it does have decent terminal UI, the ability to define a custom port range, and a loading spinner to let you know it's still iterating over ports!

Need to perform a port scan quickly and happen to have Python available? Just throw this in a terminal, and boom, you're port scanning:

`git clone https://github.com/hopkins-matt/AnotherPythonPortScanner ; cd AnotherPythonPortScanner ; python3 APPS.py`

Otherwise, save `APPS.py` wherever you'd like, and run it using `python3 APPS.py`
